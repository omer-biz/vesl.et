# Aggressive Download Manager

## The problem

I live in an area where internet is somewhat a luxury, and sometimes I need to
download (consume) content that is very big in size. 

Now to understand I don't
have my own internet, but I do get to use internet when I'm at work. The
internet at work is about `8 Mb/s`, but it gets really slow when about `50`
employees are trying to watch `youtube` at the same time. So the speed effectively
drops down to about `250 Kb/s` and that's if you are lucky enough.

You can experience the full potential of the internet when you are using it alone.
A couple days back I was watching some `youtube` myself, and I stumbled upon some
game reviews, and that immediately ignited my love for games right there and then. 

One of my favorite series of games is the Resident Evil series, I played 
Resident Evil from 4 up to 6. And while I was waiting, I couldn't play RE7
because of some issues I won't dwell into right now, for the upcoming game in
the series I looked back in the history of Resident Evil and I found that
old fans of the series loved Resident Evil 2, I did try playing the old one
but I couldn't finish it.

Fast forward to writing this post. I heard there is a remake for Resident Evil 2.
So I had to some how set up a system to "Aggressively" download the game.

## The setup

We have somewhat of a server at the office running `ubuntu` so I thought why don't
I just download the game through the server. I wrote a script which uses `wget`
to download anything
