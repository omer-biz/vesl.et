Have you ever been in a situation where there is a sudden change of things
around you? Suddenly the food is great, the mannerisms are great, suddenly
everyone is respecting everyone.

Such fluctuations are very common in my tribe, the [REDACTED], being a very proud
people, you don't often *see* anything to stain their names, but you often do
*hear* about their misdeeds.

One such example is how they treat their *respected* guests, in our case being
the diaspora more often, when they come to visit their homeland they stay with
their relatives. And the homelanders don't take this responsibility lightly, you
will see them spend lavishly, without restraint. I often wonder where could such
luxuries be hidden other times, why are they not apparent to *the common
people*.

Once, I was invited to a dinner party, it was an event held weekly and my
attendance was not lacking by any means, but the invitation was necessary
because an *important* personnel will be in our company, and I'm not to be
missing.

The gathering was lush, everyone was in attendance, even those who wished to be
scarce, "must be some guest" I thought, ordinarily a gloomy room was now
illuminated with a smiles on every face, and the giggles of the children.

When comes dinner time I couldn't believe my eyes, I thought they betrayed me,
for I saw a vast dining table filled, to the brim, with all kinds of food, I
knew the guest is going to be a royalty, for the ordinary weekly dinner party I
knew has changed to a feast.

This same routine occurs in *almost* every household, there is always a sudden
change. At first I thought "what a way to respect your kin". But I was wrong.

They don't go through all these hoops, just because they respect their kin, in
reality it's out of self respect. They don't want their kin to think they have a
lowly life, they want them to think they are living a life on par with their
kin, some to an extent of being deep in debt.
