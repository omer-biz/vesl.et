I feel compelled to describe what I mean by “elaborate” things. These are
objects, or sometimes ideas, that challenge the existing narrative, so to speak.
These objects stand out and demand attention, always serving as persistent
stimuli to our cognitive senses. We obtain them not necessarily because they
have a material use, but due to their material glitter; and as soon as a shinier
replacement comes along, we don’t even bat an eye.

The objects I’m referring to are, of course, that speaker blasting the latest
music from your neighbor’s balcony, the RGB light under your coworker’s desk and
on his keyboard, and those decorative dim lights on the streets.

If examined closely, these objects speak volumes about their owners. To put
things in perspective, we will examine two
objects: RGB lights and stereo speakers.

When was the last time you saw an RGB light? Was it at a bar? In a taxi? At a
barbershop? Why didn’t you see them at a renowned company or high-end
restaurant? What about stereo speakers? At a bar?  In a taxi? At a barbershop?
Again, why didn’t you see them at a “respectable” place?

As I have said before, it boils down to the owner. It’s no secret that people
respond to stimuli differently; what severely disturbs me might be a cakewalk
for you, and vice versa. The thing is, if our brains are not challenged enough,
they will get bored and start looking for other avenues to entertain themselves.
“Elaborate” things seem to be enough to occupy our minds until the
next shiny object comes along.

Our brains will always require something to entertain themselves. We have the
responsibility to ensure that these distractions are meaningful in the long run,
rather than simply wasting our time.

The speakers and RGB lights you have observed are often found in places where
education is scarce. Without proper education, people may become dull, and the
only modicum of entertainment that remains is the material glitter.
